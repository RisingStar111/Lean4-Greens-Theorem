Repo for a uni project

The github timeline should be accurate and fairly segmented. A lot of time was spent early in the holidays; combined with other coursework, I felt I had put enough effort in prior to the last couple days of cleanup, and this held fairly accurate. Note that much of my (major) failed workings/thought process is left in comments up until a cleanup commit (minor things were erased as I went)
My work is contained entirely within Basic.lean and WIP.lean, with what Campbell added being in Test.lean. mwe.lean was for isolating problems when working collaboratively.

Overall I'm fairly happy with what I managed, although I didn't quite manage to get the last little pieces together.
Simple calculations were often in the way and weirdly difficult to get around, and (undocumented because they were rather) shortlived attempts to automate anything went poorly, and at some point much of 'etiquette' fell by the wayside just to get something working.
The layered state of obtuse to interact with experessions made applying hypotheses very difficult at times, particular when involving deriv
Some mistakes were made in fundamentals (particularly using the absolute of the 'path velocity' in the path integral) which nicely lean threw up at the end (well, threw up nonsense so that I could spend 2 hours looking for the problem)
If I wasn't both just starting with lean and proof languages in general, and also wasn't on a time limit (and wanting to get something that did stuff), I would definitely have put more time into developing automation for much of it.
